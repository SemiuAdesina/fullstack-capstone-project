**As a** developer
**I need** to complete and organize user stories
**So that** the team has a clear development roadmap to follow

##Details and Assumptions
User stories should follow Agile methodology.
Stories will be tracked using GitHub Issues and labeled appropriately.

##Acceptance Criteria
Given the project requirements  
When I create and organize user stories  
Then they should be properly labeled and available on the GitHub Kanban board
